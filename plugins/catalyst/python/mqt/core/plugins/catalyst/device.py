"""Device utilities for MQT Catalyst Plugin.

This module provides utilities to configure PennyLane devices for use with the MQT plugin,
preventing Catalyst from decomposing gates into quantum.unitary operations with matrix parameters.
"""

def configure_device_for_mqt(device: qml.devices.Device) -> qml.devices.Device:
    """Configure a PennyLane device to work optimally with the MQT plugin.

    This function modifies device capabilities to prevent Catalyst from decomposing
    controlled gates (like qml.ctrl(PauliX)) into quantum.unitary operations with
    explicit matrix parameters. Instead, gates remain as quantum.custom operations
    (like "CNOT") that can be losslessly converted by the MQT plugin.

    The modification uses several techniques:
    1. Removes QubitUnitary from device.operations (prevents matrix decomposition path)
    2. Marks gates as controllable=True (prevents qml.ctrl() from triggering decomposition)
    3. Marks gates as invertible=True (prevents qml.adjoint() from triggering decomposition)
    4. Clears _to_matrix_ops (avoids Catalyst validation requiring QubitUnitary support)
    5. Uses qjit_capabilities hook (injects modified capabilities before QJITDevice init)

    Args:
        device: A PennyLane device instance to configure.

    Returns:
        The same device instance with modified capabilities.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the device does not have a config_filepath attribute set.

    Example:
        >>> import pennylane as qml
        >>> from mqt.core.plugins.catalyst.device import configure_device_for_mqt
        >>> dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)
