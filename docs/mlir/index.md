# MLIR in the MQT

This part of the MQT explores the capabilities of the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) in the context of compilation for quantum computing.

We define multiple dialects, each with its dedicated purpose:

- The {doc}`MQTRef dialect <MQTRef>` uses reference semantics and is designed as a compatibility dialect that simplifies translations from and to existing languages such as Qiskit, OpenQASM, or QIR.

- The {doc}`MQTOpt dialect <MQTOpt>` uses value semantics and is mainly designed for running optimizations.

Both dialects define various transformation passes.

For intercompatibility, we provide {doc}`conversions <Conversions>` between dialects.
So far, this comprises a conversion from MQTOpt to MQTRef and one from MQTRef to MQTOpt.
