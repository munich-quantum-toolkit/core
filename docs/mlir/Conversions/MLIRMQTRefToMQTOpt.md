### `-mqtref-to-mqtopt`

_Convert MQT's `Ref` to MQT's `Opt` dialect._

This pass converts all current MQTRef operations to an equivalent MQTOpt operation.
To convert them to the opt dialect, the conversion pass maintains a map that matches each ref qubit
and ref qubit register to its latest state value when replacing them with an opt operation. These state values
are obtained by updating the map with the return values of the newly created opt operations. The MQTOpt insert
operation is added when matching the dealloc operation of any qubit register. An MQTOpt insert operation is then
created for each qubit that was extracted from the qubit register and placed before the dealloc operation.
