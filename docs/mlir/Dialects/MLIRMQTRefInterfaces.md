# OpInterface definitions

## UnitaryInterface (`UnitaryInterface`)

This interface provides a generic way to interact with unitary
operations in the MQTRef dialect. Unitary operations are quantum
operations that are reversible and can be represented by a unitary
matrix. The interface provides methods to access the operands and
results of the operation.

### Methods:

#### `getInQubits`

```c++
mlir::OperandRange getInQubits();
```

Returns all qubits of the operation excl. controlling qubits.

NOTE: This method _must_ be implemented by the user.

#### `getPosCtrlInQubits`

```c++
mlir::OperandRange getPosCtrlInQubits();
```

Returns all positively-controlling qubits of the operation.

NOTE: This method _must_ be implemented by the user.

#### `getNegCtrlInQubits`

```c++
mlir::OperandRange getNegCtrlInQubits();
```

Returns all negatively-controlling qubits of the operation.

NOTE: This method _must_ be implemented by the user.

#### `getCtrlInQubits`

```c++
std::vector<mlir::Value> getCtrlInQubits();
```

Returns all controlling qubits of the operation.

NOTE: This method _must_ be implemented by the user.

#### `getAllInQubits`

```c++
std::vector<mlir::Value> getAllInQubits();
```

Returns all input qubits of the operation incl. all controlling qubits.

NOTE: This method _must_ be implemented by the user.
