# QDMI in the MQT

The [Quantum Device Management Interface (QDMI)](https://munich-quantum-software-stack.github.io/QDMI/) provides a standardized interface for describing and interacting with quantum devices.
This part of MQT Core contains the implementation of QDMI's different components, such as a [QDMI driver](driver.md), a [QDMI device for Neutral Atom Systems](na_device.md), and a [QDMI device for a Classical Quantum Circuit Simulator](ddsim_device).
